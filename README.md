# MERN Full Stack Application Scaffolding

## To use open your command line interface/bash to the desired folder and type

`git clone https://github.com/m081779/mern-scaffolding.git`

## Next, run

`yarn install && cd client && yarn install`

## This will install the necessary dependencies in your root and client directories.

## Edit the `localDB` constant in `./config/database.js` to whatever the desired Mongo database.

## A basic Mongoose user schema is provided, along with a user controller with basic CRUD functionality, and corresponding API routes.  These can be edited or deleted as your applications needs determine.

## The scaffolding will load by default a basic CRUD application where usernames and passwords can be added to the database, viewed, updated, and finally deleted.
